👋 Hi there, I’m Jiggy!

👀 I'm passionate about designing and developing tailored software solutions that precisely align with unique business needs.

🌱 I'm constantly amazed by the myriad ways to approach and solve problems. I believe that mastering the art of designing solutions and selecting the right technology—both hardware and software—is an ongoing journey that evolves every day.

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on design patterns, delve into functional programming, explore the vast realm of cloud technologies, and more. I thrive on learning and embracing new challenges in the world of software development.
