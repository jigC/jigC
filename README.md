- 👋 Hi, I’m Jiggy 

- 👀 I love a designing and developing software solutions - talioring each uniquely to cater business needs

- 🌱 I’m amazed at how many different ways/approaches are possible to address a "problem", 
      I believe learning how to best design the solution, choose technology - both hardware and software to best fit business requirements - is a continous process -
      it evolves everyday

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on design patterns, functional programming, clouds ... I love it all and am eager to learn it all
